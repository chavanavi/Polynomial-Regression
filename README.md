#   Polynomial-Regression
    Polynomial regression can be considered one of the exceptional cases of multiple linear regression models
    
 #  Steps for Polynomial Regression
Find the steps below to use polynomial regression in machine learning .

Step 1: At this step,  need to import the libraries and datasets that will(be used to perform polynomial regression). 

Step 2: The dataset needs to be divided into two components, x and y. 

Step 3: The linear regression model must be fitted into two components. 

Step 4: The polynomial regression model needs to be fitted in two components: x and y. 

Step 5: With the help of a scatter plot, one will visualize linear regression results. 

Step 6: The polynomial regression will also be viewed in this step using a scatter plot. 

Step 7: New results will now be predicted using Linear and Polynomial regression

 # Advantage – Polynomial Regression
 
The polynomial regression is flexible enough to get fitted in a vast range of curvatures.

A broad range of functions can easily fit under it. 

The polynomial regression offers the best approximation of the relationship between the two dependent and independent variables. 

# Disadvantage – Polynomial Regression
The presence of one or more outliers in the data can hurt the final results of the nonlinear analysis. 

The polynomial regression is very sensitive to the outliers. 

Very few model validation tools are available that help detect the outliers in nonlinear regression compared to the ones present for linear regression.
